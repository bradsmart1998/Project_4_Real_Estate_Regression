Over view

We are looking to create a regression model to predict the price of houses based on given features.
This map shows the sale prices of houses. We could see that the houses are more expensive in certain areas.

These graph show the spread of the data  in our numerical columns.
We do experience a large spread of results in columns such as garages (max - 99).
We also experience a large spread in house prices, most common is around $480,000 and max is nearly $2,500,000
